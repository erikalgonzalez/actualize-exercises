# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.
number = 15
if number < 10
  puts 9

  puts 19

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to slowly write the code from memory. I just have to stop double guessing myself and be more confident.
# I know with a little bit more practice I can write the code easily from memory once I do I will move on to either loops or variables.
