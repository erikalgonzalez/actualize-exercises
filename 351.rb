# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to solve this problem by memory for the most part. The only thing I had forgotten was the @ inside the def method.
