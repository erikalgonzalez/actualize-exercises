My name is Erika Gonzalez. 
I graduated from Virgina Commonwealth University in May of 2023. 
I graduated with a bachelors in International Management.
I have always found coding to be very intresting but was to scared to actually learn because many 
people told me it was to hard and that I would never get the hang of it.
Despite everything others have told me I am determined to learn coding and make a career out of it.
I hope to one day land a job in a company that really takes care of their employees.
