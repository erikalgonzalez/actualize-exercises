# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.


# Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
# For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

numbers = [5, 10, 20, 25]
new_numbers = []
index = 0
while index < numbers.length
  new_numbers << numbers[index] * 3
index += 1
end 
p new_numbers

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to solve the problem by memory but still had a little bit of doubt whether or not I am doing it right. I will continue to practice 
# until I don't second guess myself.
