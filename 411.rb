# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.

  def initialize(make, model, year, color)
    @make = make
    @model = model
    @year = year
    @color = color
  end

pp car

# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# I was able to solve the problem from memory. Next I will move on to practice the classes.
