# DELIBERATE PRACTICE REFLECTION
# Paste a deliberate practice question you are currently working on below.
# Write the code to solve the problem without looking at any notes or other resources.

#Use a variable to store a number, then write a condition that prints 0 if the number is equal to 10, and prints -1 otherwise.
x = 20
if x == 10
    puts 0
else 
 puts -1
end
# Were you able to easily solve the problem from memory?
# If so, describe the next skill you will start to practice tomorrow.
# If not, describe the part you got stuck on that requires more practice.

# It was easy to solve but I had a little trouble rembering how to start the code. I had to remember what a conditon was first to be able
# to write the code and solve the problem.
