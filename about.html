        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Hello all!</p> 
        <p>My name is Erika, and I am 22 years old. My favorite color is purple. I live in Richmond, VA. I lived in Virgina basically all my life. With just living in 
          New Jersery when I was a baby for only a few months. My family consists of my dad, my older brother, my dog and our two cats.
          My dog is a German Shepherd Husky mix. He is 1 years old and very kind. I love my beautiful boy. One day I want to move to 
          Florida with my dog. When I get settled in Florida I want to be able to help my brother and my dad to move there and get settled as well.

        <h2>My Intrests</h2>
        <p>At the moment I am learing how to code and I am really enjoying it. I also like to draw and paint even though I am not that good at drawing.
          I think being able to knit is cool, I want to try and knit a big blanket one day. Learning new dances is fun but sometimes it is a bit 
          frustraing (lol). Watching movies and tv shows on my free time is calming.
